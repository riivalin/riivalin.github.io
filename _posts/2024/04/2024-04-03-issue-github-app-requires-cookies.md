# Issue

Here is a screenshot of the issue

# Sulution

What I did was  
1. Disable 'Block all cookies' in safari.
2. Restart (I didn't do it.)
3. Open safari and login in via the browser (I don't think this step is necessary. I did it anyway.)
4. Open github app and login.
5. Go back and enable 'Block all cookies'
This worked for me.

Click the button next to the “`Block All Cookies`” tab. When it’s in the OFF position, it’ll turn grey.
