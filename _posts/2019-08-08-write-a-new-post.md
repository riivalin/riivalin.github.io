This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the _Chirpy_ template, and it's worth reading even if you've used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.

## Naming and Path

Create a new file named `YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION`{: .filepath} and put it in the `_posts`{: .filepath} of the root directory. Please note that the `EXTENSION`{: .filepath} must be one of `md`{: .filepath} and `markdown`{: .filepath}. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin [`Jekyll-Compose`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose) to accomplish this.

## Front Matter

Basically, you need to fill the [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) as below at the top of the post:

```yaml
---
title: TITLE
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT
categories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]
tags: [TAG]     # TAG names should always be lowercase
---
```

> The posts' _layout_ has been set to `post` by default, so there is no need to add the variable _layout_ in the Front Matter block.
{: .prompt-tip }

### Timezone of Date

In order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the `timezone` of `_config.yml`{: .filepath} but also provide the post's timezone in variable `date` of its Front Matter block. Format: `+/-TTTT`, e.g. `+0800`.

### Categories and Tags

The `categories` of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in `tags` can be zero to infinity. For instance:

```yaml
---
categories: [Animal, Insect]
tags: [bee]
---
```
### Author Information

The author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the _Front Matter_ , they will be obtained from variables `social.name` and the first entry of `social.links` of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:

Adding author information in `_data/authors.yml` (If your website doesn't have this file, don't hesitate to create one).

```yaml
<author_id>:
  name: <full name>
  twitter: <twitter_of_author>
  url: <homepage_of_author>
```
{: file="_data/authors.yml" }

And then use `author` to specify a single entry or `authors` to specify multiple entries:

```yaml
---
author: <author_id>                     # for single entry
# or
authors: [<author1_id>, <author2_id>]   # for multiple entries
---
```

Having said that, the key `author` can also identify multiple entries.

> The benefit of reading the author information from the file `_data/authors.yml`{: .filepath } is that the page will have the meta tag `twitter:creator`, which enriches the [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started#card-and-content-attribution) and is good for SEO.
{: .prompt-info }

## Table of Contents

By default, the **T**able **o**f **C**ontents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to `_config.yml`{: .filepath} and set the value of variable `toc` to `false`. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post's [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

```yaml
---
toc: false
---
```

## Comments

The global switch of comments is defined by variable `comments.active` in the file `_config.yml`{: .filepath}. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.

If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the **Front Matter** of the post:

```yaml
---
comments: false
---
```

## Mathematics

For website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won't be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:

```yaml
---
math: true
---
```

## Mermaid

[**Mermaid**](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) is a great diagrams generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:

```yaml
---
mermaid: true
---
```

Then you can use it like other markdown languages: surround the graph code with ```` ```mermaid ```` and ```` ``` ````.

## Images

### Caption

Add italics to the next line of an image，then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:

```markdown
![img-description](/path/to/image)
_Image Caption_
```
{: .nolineno}

### Size

In order to prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image.

```markdown
![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width="700" height="400" }
```
{: .nolineno}

> For an SVG, you have to at least specify its _width_, otherwise it won't be rendered.
{: .prompt-info }

Starting from _Chirpy v5.0.0_, `height` and `width` support abbreviations (`height` → `h`, `width` → `w`). The following example has the same effect as the above:

```markdown
![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: w="700" h="400" }
```
{: .nolineno}

### Position

By default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes `normal`, `left`, and `right`.

> Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added.
{: .prompt-warning }

- **Normal position**

  Image will be left aligned in below sample:

  ```markdown
  ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal }
  ```
  {: .nolineno}

- **Float to the left**

  ```markdown
  ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left }
  ```
  {: .nolineno}

- **Float to the right**

  ```markdown
  ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right }
  ```
  {: .nolineno}

  ### Dark/Light mode

You can make images follow theme preferences in dark/light mode. This requires you to prepare two images, one for dark mode and one for light mode, and then assign them a specific class (`dark` or `light`):

```markdown
![Light mode only](/path/to/light-mode.png){: .light }
![Dark mode only](/path/to/dark-mode.png){: .dark }
```

### Shadow

The screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect:

```markdown
![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }
```
{: .nolineno}

### CDN URL

If you host the images on the CDN, you can save the time of repeatedly writing the CDN URL by assigning the variable `img_cdn` of `_config.yml`{: .filepath} file:

```yaml
img_cdn: https://cdn.com
```
{: file='_config.yml' .nolineno}

Once `img_cdn` is assigned, the CDN URL will be added to the path of all images (images of site avatar and posts) starting with `/`.

For instance, when using images:

```markdown
![The flower](/path/to/flower.png)
```
{: .nolineno}

The parsing result will automatically add the CDN prefix `https://cdn.com` before the image path:

```html
<img src="https://cdn.com/path/to/flower.png" alt="The flower">
```
{: .nolineno }

### Image Path

When a post contains many images, it will be a time-consuming task to repeatedly define the path of the images. To solve this, we can define this path in the YAML block of the post:

```yml
---
img_path: /img/path/
---
```

And then, the image source of Markdown can write the file name directly:

```md
![The flower](flower.png)
```
{: .nolineno }

The output will be:

```html
<img src="/img/path/flower.png" alt="The flower">
```
{: .nolineno }

### Preview Image

If you want to add an image at the top of the post, please provide an image with a resolution of `1200 x 630`. Please note that if the image aspect ratio does not meet `1.91 : 1`, the image will be scaled and cropped.

Knowing these prerequisites, you can start setting the image's attribute:

```yaml
---
image:
  path: /path/to/image
  alt: image alternative text
---
```

Note that the [`img_path`](#image-path) can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the  attribute `path` only needs the image file name.

For simple use, you can also just use `image` to define the path.

```yml
---
image: /path/to/image
---
```
