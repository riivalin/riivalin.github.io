```
Why he killed him? ❌
Why they came so late? ❌

Why did he kill him? ⭕️

```

- 過去式：killed 過去分詞：killed 現在分詞：killing

# ERROR 14. 該用被動語氣的地方用了主動語氣

`be 動詞＋過去分詞（p.p.）` 

```

The books will be shipping to you. ❌ (shipping要改成p.p.)
A network has been establishing. ❌ (establishing要改成p.p.)

He was transformed into a good man. ⭕️
The books will be shipped to you. ⭕️
A network has been established. ⭕️ (網路已經建立)
```

> 被動語態動詞的基本結構是： `be 動詞＋過去分詞（p.p.）`       
> 需要時，助動詞 會視情況加進去湊熱鬧。 

> (助動詞 be ＋ 過去分詞 的結構 不一定都是被動語態)

# ERROR 15. 兩個句子中間忘了用 when, where, who ...等

```

I am a person swims every morning. ❌ 

He is a man who can run very fast. ⭕️

---

- `which`, `Who` 必要資訊，有逗號
- `which`, `Who` 補充資訊，無逗號
- `that` 必要資訊，不能有逗號

# ERROR 16. 忘了在 which, that ... 後面應該用子句，而非片語

(子句就是有主詞有動詞的字群)

We offen use appliances which made in Japan. ❌ 

We should not leave before the concert ends. ⭕️
We cannot win if we lock courage. ⭕️
We offen use appliances which are made in Japan. ⭕️
```

> 子句是什麼意思？      
> 子句是由一群相關並含有主詞與動詞的字所組成。 子句有兩種：獨立子句與從屬子句。 獨立子句能表達完整思維可單獨存在。 從屬子句又稱為附屬子句，它不能單獨存在，必須依附獨立子句才會有意義。

## 分語是什麼?
### eat：原形動詞

```
ate：過去式
eaten：過去分詞   (或稱 p.p.)
eating：現在分詞   (或稱 V-ing )
eats：動詞 +s
```
你有沒有發現「分詞」在哪裡呢？🤩  沒錯！「現在分詞」和「過去分詞」都是分詞喔！😎

簡單來說，分詞的定義就是一種「動詞變化」，可以分為「現在分詞」和「過去分詞」。

👉🏻「現在分詞」或稱為 V-ing，最常見的就是「動詞 +ing」的型態。

👉🏻「過去分詞」或稱為 p.p. (past participle)，就是動詞三態表裡面的第三個，最常見的就是「動詞 +ed」。除此之外，過去分詞也有其他不規則的形式，像是「eat / ate / eaten」、「make / made / made」，它們的過去分詞就是不規則的變化。

分詞的功能很多樣，除了用來形成「時態」，也可以用來形成「被動語態」，也可以當「形容詞」修飾人事物，還可以用來簡化句子，也就是文法老師常說的「分詞構句」。聽起來是不是很厲害呢～👍🏻

He will be disappeared. ❌
The war will be happened soon. ❌
Wars were occurred many times in China. ❌

Your paper will appear soon. ⭕️
He will disappear. ⭕️
The war will happen soon. ⭕️
Wars occurred many times in China. ⭕️

您的論文很快就會出現。

I cannot live in poverty. ⭕️
This cannot eliminate the possibility of wars. ⭕️

```

# ERROR 22. 不該用疑問句的子句用了疑問句
