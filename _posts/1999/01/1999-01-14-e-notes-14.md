將否定句或問句改成被動語氣，其步驟：

1. 將此句子改成肯定句
2. 將此肯定句子改成被動語氣 (`助動詞 be ＋過去分詞`)
3. 將此被動語氣的句子改成否定句

例如：

```
I did not take this picture.
```

1. 對應的肯定句     
I `took` this picture.

2. 改成被動語氣 (`助動詞 be ＋過去分詞`)        
This picture `was taken` by me.

3. 改成否定句       
This picture `was not taken` by me.


> 問句也可以依此步驟：  
> 1. 問句變肯定句   
> 2. 再改成被動語氣 (`助動詞 be ＋過去分詞`)    
> 3. 改回問句   
>   
> 例如： Did you eat that cake?
> 1. You `ate` that cake
> 2. That cake `was eaten` by you.
> 3. `Was` that cake `eaten` by you?
