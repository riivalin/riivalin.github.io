#### 片語(phrase)

```
Understanding English is easy.
I want you to work hard.
```
`Understanding English`和`work hard`內部沒有主詞，也沒有動詞，這種字群，叫做片語(phrase)。

#### 子句(clause)

```
Peter, who has been to England, speaks good English.
I told him that I was going away.
```

`who has been to England`和 `I was going away` 內部有主詞和動詞，這種字群，叫做子句(clause)。

1. 問題型式的名詞子句
2. 以`that`開始的名詞子句
3. 形容詞子句


# 1. 問題型式的名詞子句

句子中充當名詞用的子句就是名詞子句。
每一個問題型式的名詞子句都要用 `who`, `where`, `whether`, `which` 等來開始。
	
範例:   
- I don’t know `where he came from.`    
我不知道他來自何處。

- I will find out `where he is living.` 
我要找出他住在哪裡。    

- Please let me know `how old he is.`       
請讓我知道他多大年紀。  

- Do you know `who he is?`  
你知道他是誰嗎？

## 不能在名詞子句中用問句的型式

每一個名詞都有問題的意義，我們不能在名詞子句中用問句的型式，因為畢竟名詞子句僅僅是一個子句而已。

#### 錯誤範例1：

```
I don’t know where did he come from. ❌ 
```
I don’t know `where he came from.` ⭕️

#### 錯誤範例2：

```
I will find out how old is he. ❌
```
I will find out `how old he is.` ⭕️

## 練習

```
我不知道你是誰。
I do not know who you are.

你知道他是誰嗎?
Do you know who he is?

我知道天空為什麼是藍的。
I know why the sky is blue.
```

# 2. 以 that 開始的名詞子句

### 範例:

- `That` the sun rises from the west is wrong.  
太陽從西邊升起的說法是錯誤的。

- I purpose `that` we get married.  
我建議我們結婚。

- I demand `that` you go away.     
我要求你離開。


### 錯誤範例1: 

```
地球是圓的是眾所皆知的事。
The earth is round is known to everyone. ❌
```

上述句子是錯的，我們必須加一個 `that` 到名詞子句。  
- `That` the earth is round is known to everyone.  ⭕️

### 錯誤範例2: 

```
我要求他一定要用功讀書。
I demand he must work hard. ❌
```

我們應該加一個`that`在名詞子句的前面。
- I demand `that` he must work hard. ⭕️

雖然我們常常會看到”that”被省略的情形，  
為保險起見，最好不要省略that。

## 練習

請將that加到句子中:   

```
I am glad you are here now.     
```

I am glad `that` you are here now.

```
He is an American is unknown to us.     
```

`That` he is an American is unknown to us.

```
I do not think he is a bad student.  
```
   
I do not think `that` he is a bad student.


# 3. 形容詞子句

形容詞子句永遠都是在形容一個名詞，因此我們在這個子句必須有一個代名詞，      
像 `who`, `when`, `where`, `whom` 等。

### 舉例

不能譯成以下句子：

```
住在那棟房子裡的人是我的哥哥。
The person live in that house is my brother. ❌ 
```

- 步驟1： 先將 live in the house 改成 `living in the house` 片語。  
The person `living in the house` <u>is my brother</u>.  

- 步驟2：再將片語 living in the house 改成 子句 `who lives in the house`。      

它的作用是形容 `The person`，所以是一個形容詞子句。  
The person `who lives in the house` is my brother.  


### 例如: (以下為形容詞子句) 

- <u>The storm</u> `which hit India` last week is very strong.   
上週襲擊印度的風暴非常強烈。

- <u>I met your uncle</u> `who has a red car`.    
我遇見了你那位有一輛紅色汽車的叔叔。


## 子句的最後一個字是一個介系詞 (to)，應該要放到前面去

### 錯誤範例: 

下述兩子句的最後一個字是一個介系詞。

#### 範例:
 
- The party which I went `to` is interesting.
- The professor whom I spoke `to` is very friendly.

上述兩子句的最後一個字是一個介系詞。

#### 正式的英文中，我們應該改成:

- The party `to` which I went is interesting.
- The professor `to` whom I spoke is very friendly.


### 說明

```
The party which I went to is interesting. ❌    
```

這句話可以分成兩句來講：

- The party is interesting.
- I went to The party

所以將兩個子句合在一起：The party `which I went to` is interesting
(子句的最後一個字是一個介系詞)

但，正式的講法應該是：(`to`應該要放到前面去)

- The party `to which I went` is interesting. ⭕️


```
The professor whom I spoke to is very friendly. ❌  
```

正式的講法應該是：(`to`應該要放到前面去)

The professor `to whom I spoke` is very friendly. ⭕️

## 多餘的it

範例:

- I like the book which you gave `it` to me. ❌ 


上述句子中的`it`是多餘的，因為 `gave` 的受
詞是`which` 不需要加`it`。      

- I like the book `which you gave to me`. ⭕️


## 練習改錯:

I like to talk to people `which` are friendly. ❌   
I like to talk to people `who` are friendly. ⭕️

I enjoy reading the book `which you gave it` to me. ❌ (多餘的it)       
I enjoy reading the book `which you gave` to me. ⭕️ 

Do you know the person `which` everyone knows? ❌       
Do you know the person `whom` everyone knows? ⭕️
        
# 補充

動詞為 agree, ask, believe, find, forget, guess, hear, 
hope, know, notice, remember, say, see, tell, think, 
understand 等時，這時的連接詞 that 可省略。
