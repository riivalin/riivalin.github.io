# 肯定句是什麼？

```
I am a student.
我是學生

He likes fast food.
他喜歡速食

They can speak English.
他們會說英語
```

從這些句子我們可以了解，肯定句就是用來「表示肯定」的句子，能用來表達「真實、肯定」的意思，通常用來敘述一件事實或肯定的事。


# 否定句是什麼？

```
I am not a student.
我不是學生

He does not like fast food.
他不喜歡速食

They cannot speak English.
他們不會說英語
```

看完這些句子你會發現，他們跟剛剛那些句子的差別在於，這些句子都出現了 `not` 這個否定的詞。所以句子從原本的肯定變成了否定的意思。

所以，我們就能了解，否定句是用來表達「否認、反對、拒絕」等意思的句子，通常在句子裡會出現 not，用來否定某一件事。

> 有些字本質上已具備了 `not` 或 `no` 等否定的意思，例如`none`, `never`, `nothing`, `nobody`, `nowhere`, `no one`, `nor`, `neither`, `seldom`, `hardly`, `barely`, `scarcely`。不要把兩個具有否定意思的字連在一起，應避免使用雙重否定。


# 如何把肯定句變成否定句？

要怎麼把肯定句變成否定句呢？主要有幾個方法：

1. 句子有「be 動詞」時，在後面加 not
2. 句子有「助動詞」時，在後面加上 not
3. 句子有「一般動詞」時，在前面加 do not / does not     
如果是「一般動詞的過去式」，前面都統一加上 did not



## 1. 句子有「be 動詞」時，在後面加 not

be 動詞加 not 的形式還可以用「縮寫」來表達，像是： 
- `is not` = `‘s not` / `isn’t`
- `was not` = `wasn’t` 

### 例如：

- I am happy.  👉🏻  I am not happy.

- He is happy.  👉🏻  He is not happy. = He‘s not happy. = He isn’t happy.

- She was happy.  👉🏻  She was not happy. = He wasn’t happy.

- They are happy.  👉🏻  They are not happy. =  They‘re not happy.  =  They aren’t happy.

- They were happy. 👉🏻  They were not happy. = They weren’t happy.


## 2. 句子有「助動詞」時，在後面加上 not

- I will call you.  👉🏻  I will not call you.

- He can sing.  👉🏻  He cannot sing.

- We have cleaned the table.  👉🏻  We have not cleaned the table.

- They should go out.  👉🏻  They should not go out.

### 通常助動詞後面加 not，也可以用縮寫來表達：

- will not = won’t
- would not = wouldn’t
- cannot = can’t
- could not = couldn’t
- have not = haven’t
- has not = hasn’t
- had not = hadn’t
- should not = shouldn’t


```
I will not call you.  =  I won’t call you.

He cannot sing. =  He can’t sing.

We have not cleaned the table. = We haven’t cleaned the table.

They should not go out. = They shouldn’t go out.
```

## 3. 句子有「一般動詞」時，在前面加 do not / does not     
如果是「一般動詞的過去式」，前面都統一加上 did not

首先，如果句子有一般動詞的話，要注意前面的主詞是什麼，再根據主詞來決定要加 `do not` 還是 `does not`。如果主詞是：I / You / We / They 的時候，就要用 do not

### 主詞是：I / You / We / They 的時候，就要用 do not

```
I like apples.  👉🏻  I do not like apples.

You like apples.  👉🏻  You do not like apples.

They like apples.  👉🏻  They do not like apples.
```

### 主詞是：He / She / It，或是單一個人的時候，用 does not

那如果主詞是：He / She / It，或是單一個人的時候，就要用 does not。

> 必須注意的是，在 does not 後面出現的動詞，直接用原形動詞就可以，不用特別加 s：


```
He likes apples.  👉🏻  He does not like apples.

She likes apples.  👉🏻  She does not like apples.

John likes apples.   👉🏻  John does not like apples.
```

### 句子裡有「一般動詞的過去式」的話，在動詞前面統一加上 did not

接下來，如果句子裡有「一般動詞的過去式」的話，在動詞前面統一加上 did not 就可以了！

> 但是要記得，did not 後面的動詞必須改回原形動詞，不再用過去式動詞。

```
I found the dog.  👉🏻  I did not find the dog.

He found the dog.  👉🏻  He did not find the dog.

They found the dog.  👉🏻  They did not find the dog.
```

### do not / does not / did not 也可以用縮寫

那 do not / does not / did not 也可以用縮寫的形式來表達：

- do not = don’t
- does not = doesn’t
- did not = didn’t

```
I do not like apples.  =  I don’t like apples.

He does not like apples.  =  He doesn’t like apples.

I did not find the dog.  =  I didn’t find the dog.
```


# 其他否定詞的用法

除了在 be 動詞、助動詞、一般動詞後面加 not 以外，還有一些否定詞可以用來表示否定。嚴格來說，包含這些否定詞的句子都可以稱為否定句：

- no  沒有
- nobody  沒有人
- nothing  沒有事情、沒有東西
- neither  兩者都不
- none  都不  (某範圍以內都沒有)
- never  從不、絕不

## 相關例句：

```
I have no friends.
我沒有朋友

Nobody is in this room.
這個房間裡沒人

I saw nothing in the bag.
包包裡我什麼都沒看到

Neither of the boys was here.
這兩個男孩都不在這裡

None of the kids went to school.
這些小孩都沒去學校

We never drink coffee at night.
我們從來不在晚上喝咖啡
```
